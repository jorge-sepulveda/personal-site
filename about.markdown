I'm a cloud engineer at American Express. Go as my main language and I work on processing financial transactions in real time. We use a Cassandra database for horizontal scalability and Redis for caching data that requires immediate lookups. After working here for a few years, I've learned the importance of stable financial systems. The funny part is that people REALLY care about money, where it goes, how it will get processed and it adds to the complexity. 

It's really fun. There's always new problems to be solved and existing problems are always parts of a puzzle. I happen to love puzzles and one of the best parts about my day are solving problems. Wether it's finding one bad transaction out of a million every day, troubleshooting environment issues or cracking down on memory leaks, I tackle anything head on.

In my free time I read, play videogames and work on any small projects I'm working on. Whatever I'm feeling, really.
