## re4-pick-a-gun service

Resident evil 4 is one of my favorite games. I like to spice up a run and pick a random weapon to use for the chapter. 16 weapons, over 20 weapons some good and some not so good. I decided to write some code to keep track of my progress and I've turned it into a fully fledged UI. You can pick a gun, save your progress and load it. This was all made using Go's standard library and I used [Fyne] to implement a front end.

Here's the repo in case you happen to like the game too and wanna spice up a run: <https://github.com/jorge-sepulveda/re4-pick-a-gun/>
