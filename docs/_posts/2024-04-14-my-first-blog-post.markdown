{{page.excerpt}}
I've always wanted to make a website but I just haven't done it, 
I've used Angular and React in the past but it felt like I was pulled into it.
really like simple looking sites(maybe that's why I'm a backend guy.)
A few tutorials later and here we are, hosting a pretty simple looking site and hosted for free using Github Pages. 
I have a few ideas of the CSS styling that I want but this will be a great start to have a blogging situation. 

I like reading programming books and I always want to share some snippets that I learn and Jekyll can do just that! 
I may even make some tutorials to make this blog helpful for readers. The opportunites are limitless in my opinion.
This will fit all of my needs for the future. Next step is getting my hosted website on here.
